# simpleXjs
A simple action platformer in javascript. I hope to make it become a metroidvania sooner or later.
Just download all the files and open the .html.
I'm from Italy so sometimes comments and variable names may be in italian.

Load the .savegame file to play with all the implemented functionalities.
